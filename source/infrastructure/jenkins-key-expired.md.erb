# How To Renew The Jenkins GPG Key

If you see an error stating that this key has expired, please contact the SRE
team. You may encounter this error when trying to re-encrypt the secrets in

If you are a member of the SRE team and you are looking for further
documentation, please see the instructions in Google Drive in the private GovWifi
Team folder (Govwifi > Technical:developer work > Tech Docs ) entitled
